# libwintc-shcommon
This directory contains the source code for the common shell utilities library.

## Purpose
This library provides common utilities and constants related to the shell, such that programs do not need to depend on the main shell library when they only need some common stuff. This includes constants for the known folders and path manipulation functions.
