# libwintc-shlang
This directory contains the source code for the common shell language strings library.

## Purpose
This library acts as a central location for retrieving translated language strings for text used throughout many programs and the shell. This includes strings for known folders (eg. *Recycle Bin*, *Control Panel*), and for labels commonly used on controls (eg. *OK*, *Cancel*, *Print*).
