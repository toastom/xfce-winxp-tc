## Hello World!

Herein lies the automatically generated HTML documentation for the *Windows "Total Conversion" API*. This documentation, as well as the APIs themselves, are extremely preliminary and **not stable**.

## Have a poke around

Feel free to have a look around the documentation regardless, and maybe even write your own programs or extensions with this information. The project is designed with extension in mind and one day will hopefully provide stable APIs to interface with systems no matter the distro or the particular software choices on the end user's machine (eg. systemd/runit).

## Any errors?

Please report any mistakes or problems you encounter to the project's GitHub issues page. Thank you!
